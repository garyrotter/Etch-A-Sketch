OVERALL PROJECT TASKS:

[X] Build HTML framework
[] add CSS

[] Create a page with 16x16 grid of square divs
    [X] Create the divs using JS
    [X] Best to put your grid squares inside another "container" div (put directly into HTML)
    [X] Different ways to make the divs appear as a grid
        [] float/clear
        [] inline-block
        [] flexbox
        [X] CSS Grid
    [X] Be careful with borders and margins, they can adjust the size of squares!
    [X] "OMG, Why isn't my grid being created???"

[] Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
    [] Hint: “hovering” is what happens when your mouse enters a div and ends when your mouse leaves it.. you can set up event listeners for either of those events as a starting point.
    [] There are multiple ways to change the color of the divs, including:
        [] adding a new class to the div
        [] changing the div’s background color using JavaScript.

[] Add a button to the top of the screen which will clear the current grid and send the user a popup asking for how many squares per side to make the new grid.
    [] Once entered the new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) and now you’ve got a new sketch pad. 
    [] Tip: Set the limit for the user input to a maximum of 100. A larger number of squares results in more computer resources being used, resulting in possible delays, freezing, or crashing that we want  to prevent.
    [] Research button tags in HTML and how you can make a JavaScript function run when one is clicked.
    [] Also check out prompts
    [] You should be able to enter 64 and have a brand new 64x64 grid pop up without changing the total amount of pixels used

[] (Optional): Instead of just changing the color of your grid from black to white (for example) have each pass through it with the mouse change to a completely random RGB value. Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black.

[] Push your project to GitHub!
